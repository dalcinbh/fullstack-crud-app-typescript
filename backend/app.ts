/**
 * Main Application Entry Point
 * 
 * This file contains the primary Express.js application setup and configuration.
 * It implements a class-based architecture for organizing the application lifecycle,
 * including middleware setup, route configuration, database connection, and server
 * management with graceful shutdown handling.
 * 
 * The application follows these key principles:
 * - Clean separation of concerns through method organization
 * - Proper error handling and logging
 * - Graceful shutdown for production reliability
 * - Environment-based configuration
 * - CORS configuration for frontend integration
 * 
 * Environment Variables Required:
 * - PORT: Server port (defaults to 5000)
 * - FRONTEND_URL: Frontend URL for CORS (defaults to "*")
 * - DATABASE_URL: Database connection string
 * - NODE_ENV: Environment mode (development/production)
